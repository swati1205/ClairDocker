CVE-2013-7040 (Negligible)
	Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to randomize
	hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without restricting
	the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and makes it easier for
	context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
	via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.  NOTE: this
	vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1150.

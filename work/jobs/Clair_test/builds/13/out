CVE-2010-0928 (Negligible)
	OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro
	FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm for certain signature
	calculations, and does not verify the signature before providing it to a caller,
	which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to determine the
	private key via a modified supply voltage for the microprocessor, related to a
	"fault-based attack."

	Package:       openssl @ 1.1.0e-1
	Link:          https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0928
	Layer:         4422c3eedaf872aae7b04829a2fb40f4e89274113fec2a7f5f7c3f40a06d4ade

CVE-2013-4392 (Negligible)
	systemd, when updating file permissions, allows local users to change the
	permissions and SELinux security contexts for arbitrary files via a symlink
	attack on unspecified files.

	Package:       systemd @ 215-17+deb8u6
	Link:          https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4392

CVE-2015-8985 (Negligible)
	The pop_fail_stack function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) allows
	context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure
	and application crash) via vectors related to extended regular expression
	processing.

	Package:       glibc @ 2.19-18+deb8u7
	Link:          https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8985
